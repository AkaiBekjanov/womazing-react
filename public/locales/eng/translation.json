Like many Italian firms, Womazing remains a family company, although none of the family members are fashion designers.\n\nWe follow a successful formula, using the services of well-known fashion designers to create our collections. The method has been described by fashion critic Colin McDowell as a form of design co-creation characteristic of a number of Italian prêt-a-porter companies."

The desire to produce clothes for the masses carried great promise, especially at a time when high fashion still dominated and the market for quality prêt-a-porter simply did not exist.",
